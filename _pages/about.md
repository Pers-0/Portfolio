To me, gaming is among the human instincts that requires no pre-knowledge to engage with. Curiosity penetrates our motivations, sense of achievements and critical thinking. Nevertheless, before involvement in game-design practices my interest in data-driven projects only concerns their potential in capturing aggregate patterns, unveiling mechanisms in causal relationships, and producing more intuitive outcomes to interpret and communicate, as if the thin red line between creative, pragmatic and critical contributions were ontological.

Respect for client self-determination is central in the field of social work, not only because it's ultimately the clients' war to fight, but also due to the fact that they hold specific valuable knowledge that's not always articulable. In the same vein, I believe to make a game is not to educate or to tell the gamers what to know/do, but to share a few moments with souls that feel like doing it-- at that moment, in that space.
